# ✨ Gravity of Joy

**Gravity of Joy** is a kinetic, mobile-first web app designed to turn your positive thoughts into a physical-feeling experience. Using your phone's tilt and motion sensors, you can interact with your "joys" as if they were marbles in a jar.

## 📱 Features

- **Physical Presence:** Uses the **Matter.js** physics engine to give emojis weight, bounce, and friction.
- **Motion Interaction:** Uses the **Device Orientation API** so the emojis tumble and roll as you tilt your phone.
- **Shake to Clear:** Too many joys? Give your phone a firm shake to watch them fly away and reset the space.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Feel the "click" of a new joy and the "rumble" of a reset (on supported devices).
- **No Install Required:** Hosted entirely on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the link** on your mobile browser.
2. **Grant Permission:** Tap "Enter Space" and allow access to motion/orientation sensors.
3. **Add Joys:** Tap the button to drop emojis into your jar.
4. **Play:** Tilt your phone to see them roll. Shake it to clear the screen!
